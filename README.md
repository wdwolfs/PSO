# PSO
Particle Swarm Optimizer designed with empirical potential fitting in mind
Empirical atomic potentials like the modified embedded atom method frequently use a large number of parameters in order to estimate the potential energy surface of a many body system.  Particle Swarm Optimization is one way of attempting to optimize those parameters.

This project uses a few input files along with an executable to achieve that goal.
